// 16. Aim of the program : Illustrate the execution of constructors in multi-level  inheritance with three Java classes â€“ plate(length, width), box(length, width, height), wood box (length, width, height, thick) where box inherits from plate and woodbox inherits from box class. Each class has constructor where dimensions are taken from user.
// Input: Enter the dimensions
// Output: Display the dimensions accordingly
